## Project Overview

**SocialWave** is an application that aims to simulate a social network, offering an interactive platform for connection and sharing. This project is developed as part of the CodeAlpha internship program, focusing on Full Stack development, and implements the essential functionalities of a social media application.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

*   `client/`: Contains the front-end application code.
*   `server/`: Contains the back-end application code.

## Features

*   User authentication and authorization
*   User profile creation and management
*   Post creation and management
*   Commenting on posts
*   Liking posts and comments
*   Following/unfollowing users
*   Community management
*   Admin dashboard (if implemented)
*   Content moderation (if implemented)

## Technologies

### Front-end (Client)

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of reusable UI components and efficient management of application state.
*   **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript applications, often used with React for centralized application state management.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level classes to build custom designs directly in your markup, thus accelerating the styling process.
*   **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for front-end logic, interactivity, and communication with the server.

### Back-end (Server)

*   **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment, enabling the building of scalable and high-performance network applications.
*   **Express.js**: A minimalist and flexible web framework for Node.js, used to build robust RESTful APIs and manage routes and HTTP requests.
*   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL document-oriented database, used to store application data in a flexible and scalable manner.
*   **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB, which provides a schema-based solution to model your application data and interact with the MongoDB database.
*   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication, enabling secure communication between the client and server via signed tokens.
*   **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware for Node.js, offering a flexible and modular approach to handle various authentication strategies (local, OAuth, etc.).

## Schema Diagram

A schema diagram of the database or system architecture is not currently available in the repository. This could be a future improvement for the project to provide a visual overview of the data structure and relationships.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js
*   MongoDB (or a MongoDB Atlas account)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/hamzakh86/codeAlpha-SocialWave.git
    ```
    
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```shell
    cd codeAlpha-SocialWave
    ```
    
3.  Install dependencies for both the client and server. Detailed instructions are available in the respective `README.md` files in the `client` and `server` folders.
    

### Execution

To start the application, follow the specific instructions provided in the `README.md` files in the `client` and `server` folders.

*   **Client (Front-end)**:
    1.  Ensure you are in the `client/` directory.
    2.  Run the start command:
        ```shell
        npm start
        # or
        yarn start
        ```
        This will launch a local development server and open the application in your default browser, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

*   **Server (Back-end)**:
    1.  Ensure you are in the `server/` directory.
    2.  Run the start command:
        ```shell
        npm start
        # or
        node app.js
        ```
        This will launch the Node.js server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

The SocialWave application simulates a social network where users can register, log in, create and manage their profiles, post content, comment on other users' posts, like posts and comments, and follow/unfollow other users. Key functionalities include:

*   **Account Management**: Registration, login, logout.
*   **User Profile**: Creation, editing, and viewing of your own profile and those of other users.
*   **News Feed**: Display of posts from users you follow.
*   **Interaction**: Posting, commenting, liking, and sharing content.
*   **Networking**: Following other users to see their activities.

The application is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate between different sections and interact with content.

## Application Overview

(To be added: Screenshots or a brief description of the SocialWave user interface will be inserted here to provide a visual overview of the application.)
